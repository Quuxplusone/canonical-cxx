This repository may eventually contain "canonical" or
"best-practices" skeletons for various kinds of classes
that come up again and again in C++:

  - completely generic `class Widget`
  - `forward_iterator` class
  - `random_access_iterator` class
  - `allocator` class
  - `istream` subclass
  - `ostream` subclass
  - sequence container class
